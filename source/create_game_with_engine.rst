Creating a Game with the R-Type Engine
======================================

This guide will help you create a new game using the R-Type game engine. We'll walk through setting up the engine, creating game elements, and adding some basic gameplay features.

Getting Started
---------------

First, you need to set up the engine on your machine.

1. **Clone the Engine Repository**: Download the engine source code.

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rtype-engine.git
      cd rtype-engine

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required libraries like SFML for graphics and Boost for networking.

   .. code-block:: bash

      ./setup.sh  # Run setup script
      # Or install dependencies manually
      sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev libboost-all-dev

3. **Build the Engine**: Now compile the engine using `make` or CMake.

   .. code-block:: bash

      make  # or cmake .
      ./build/mygameengine

Now that the engine is ready, you can start creating your game.

Creating Game Elements
-----------------------

The engine uses something called **Entity-Component System (ECS)** to organize game objects.

- **Entities**: These are things in the game (like players, enemies, bullets).
- **Components**: These are properties of entities (like position, speed, health).
- **Systems**: These are the logic that updates the game (like moving entities or detecting collisions).

### Step 1: Create Entities

You first need to define your game objects (entities). For example, to create a player and enemies:

   .. code-block:: cpp

      create_entity

### Step 2: Add Components

Next, give each entity some properties (components). For example, you can give them positions or graphics.

   .. code-block:: cpp

      player.components

### Step 3: Add Logic with Systems

Finally, you need to add systems that control how entities behave. For example, you might create a system to move the player when you press a key.

   .. code-block:: cpp

      movement

Making the Game Interactive
----------------------------

### Handling Input

To make the game interactive, you can use the **Input System** to control the player. For example, move the player when pressing the arrow keys.

   .. code-block:: cpp

      input

### Adding Enemies and Collisions

You can create enemy entities and make a system to check for collisions between the player and enemies. If a collision happens, you can reduce health or trigger other events.

   .. code-block:: cpp

      colision

Networking with the Engine
---------------------------

If you want to make your game multiplayer, the engine has a **Networking Module** that allows communication between players and the server.

### Setting Up the Server

1. **Start the Game Server**: The server manages the game state and sends updates to clients (players).

   .. code-block:: bash

      ./rtype-server

2. **Client-Server Communication**: The engine uses the UDP protocol to send messages between the server and clients. You can customize the communication protocol for your game if needed.
